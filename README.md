## Business Issue Tracking System

Business Issue Tracking System / BITS is a Web Application made with different technologies. Those technology stacks are divided into the frontend, the middleware, the backend, the cloud, and the API.

### Frontend
This simplifies the user-to-machine interaction by giving a user-friendly interfaces. I used markup/web languages such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), Javascript and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for developing the user interface. Also I used front-end frameworks such as:
- **Twitter Bootstrap** - Bootstrap is a free and open source front end development framework for the creation of websites and web apps.
- **jQuery** - jQuery is a Javascript Library that simplifies Javascript Programming.  

To simplify, HTML is just a string of words interpreted by the web browsers, the CSS allows us to style our HTML, and the javascript adds the interactive features like animations, etc..

### Language/Framework
The programming language acts as a middleware between the frontend and the backend. This concerns the actual processing of the data. So basically the frontend accepts the inputs, processed by the **middleware** which in our case *python* then saves it to the database.
- **Python** - is a High-Level programming language

### Database
  SQLite/PostgreSQL  
### Deployment
  PythonAnywhere  
  AWS Elastic Beanstalk
