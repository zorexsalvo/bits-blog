## Business Issue Tracking System

Business Issue Tracking System / BITS is a Web Application made with different technologies. Those technology stacks are divided into the frontend, the middleware, the backend, the cloud, and the API.

### Frontend
This simplifies the user-to-machine interaction by giving a user-friendly interfaces. I used markup/web languages such as HTML, Javascript and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) for developing the user interface. Also I used front-end frameworks such as:
- **Twitter Bootstrap** - Bootstrap is a free and open source front end development framework for the creation of websites and web apps.
- **jQuery** - jQuery is a Javascript Library that simplifies Javascript Programming.
